        newsArticle={"The Hit Box is perhaps the most extraordinary way to play a fighting game. I've played fighting games since Street Fighter II first hit the SNES, and though I'm not a dominant player, I love them anyway. I've played with virtually every fighting stick or controller you can from homemade sticks using an Xbox 360 shell to Razer's latest arcade stick. With that in mind, nothing so far has felt as good compared to Hit Box. It doesn't cause as much fatigue after several hours of playing, feels good, and the inputs feel responsive. It looks intimidating, and while it has a learning curve, the Hit Box is a remarkable piece of technology. Many have accused fighting game players of cheating with the Hit Box, and while some have modified their controllers, simply owning and using this does not make you a cheater. Opening your controller and changing it to make macro buttons makes you a cheater."}/>
