        newsArticle={"I reported my findings to the PR rep that I was working with and even included details on the drum I used for my review. They mentioned that they will pass this information to the team and perhaps the drum might be compatible in a future firmware. However, as an adapter for standard controllers, I would absolutely recommend the Wingman XB as I didn?t have to re-pair the DualShock when I switched usage between the PC and the Xbox One. I would caution that before you buy, please visit the brook website and read through the compatibility list to ensure the controller you plan on using will work. If it?s on the list you should be set! The Wingman XB is available on Amazon and wherever Brook products are sold."}/>
